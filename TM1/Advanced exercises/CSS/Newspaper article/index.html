        “Today, we present humanity with a groundbreaking new view of the cosmos
        from the James Webb Space Telescope - a view the world has never seen
        before,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “These images, including
        the deepest infrared view of our universe that has ever been taken, show
        us how Webb will help to uncover the answers to questions we don't even
        yet know to ask; questions that will help us better understand our
        universe and humanity's place within it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The Webb team's incredible success is a reflection of what NASA does
        best. We take dreams and turn them into reality for the benefit of
        humanity. I can't wait to see the discoveries that we uncover - the team
        is just getting started!”
      </p>

      <p>
        NASA explores the unknown in space for the benefit of all, and Webb's
        first observations tell the story of the hidden universe through every
        phase of cosmic history - from neighboring planets outside our solar
        system, known as exoplanets, to the most distant observable galaxies in
        the early universe.
      </p>

        “This is a singular and historic moment,” said Thomas Zurbuchen,
        associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. “It took
        decades of drive and perseverance to get us here, and I am immensely
        proud of the Webb team. These first images show us how much we can
        accomplish when we come together behind a shared goal, to solve the
        cosmic mysteries that connect us all. It's a stunning glimpse of the
        insights yet to come.”
      </p>

        “We are elated to celebrate this extraordinary day with the world,” said
        Greg Robinson, Webb program director at NASA Headquarters. “The
        beautiful diversity and incredible detail of the Webb telescope's images
        and data will have a profound impact on our understanding of the
        universe and inspire us to dream big."
